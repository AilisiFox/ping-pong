# ping-pong
The ping pong game is developed in the high-level Python language. When you start the game, 3 objects appear on the screen: 1st racket, ball, 2nd racket. The point of the game is to hit the ball with rackets and not let it go beyond the boundaries of the game screen. We hope you enjoy our game, good luck!
